Referral template which you can follow :)

Hi {Name of the person),

I hope you are doing well. Recently, I came across an opening at {Company Name} for a (Role) position for (Year of Graduation} graduates or {Years of experience}

The job ID for the position is {Job ID}.

It would be great if you could provide me with a referral.

Why me?

-> {Mention all your achievements}

-> {If applying for technical roles, mention your projects, coding profiles, and ranks}

-> {Achievements should be listed in bullet points}

-> {Achievements should be one-liners. Please don't explain everything in a paragraph}

I have attached my resume for your review.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks, (Your Name)
