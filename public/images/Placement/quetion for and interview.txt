what intrest you to wwork for this company =>

To be honest, I don’t know much about your company at the moment, but if my profile gets shortlisted, I will take the time to learn more about it. Currently, what excites me most is this opportunity to showcase my skills.
I may not have 2-3 years of experience, but with 1.4 years of hands-on experience, I have gained solid knowledge and understanding of the work I’ve done. I am eager to contribute to your team and collaborate with talented individuals who are driven to create innovative solutions or turn ideas into reality.
Thank you for taking the time, and if you’ve read my response, I truly appreciate it.


While sending Connection request:

Hey [Name], How are you? 
I came across an opening at [company] for [z] role, [job id]. I graduated from [college] and have [x] years of experience in the Product team at [company]. I find myself a right fit for the role, can you refer me for the same?

I came across an opening at juleo for FrontEnd intern role I  have 1+ years of experience in the Groupon technologies I find myself a right fit for the role can you refer me for the same? thank you .

📍If connection request is accepted ( you don’t want to delay this, be very proactive here):

Hey [Name], thanks for accepting my request.
Sharing you my resume below, would be really helpful if you could provide a referral.

📍If they have shared resume with hiring team and you want to follow up:

Hey [Name],
I was wondering if you could advise me on how I can track the progress of my application at [company]? Do you have a specific portal or should I follow up with someone directly?

P.S: Once I realised that only asking for referral isn’t enough, it’s equally important to follow up and keep a track that you actually have received a referral also.

💡This trick definitely increased my conversions of getting referred 2-3x.

Do try this out!
